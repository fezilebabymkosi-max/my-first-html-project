      <section id="introduction">One of my favorite hobbies is spending quiet moments reading novels,
        especially fiction books that take me to new worlds and spark my imagination. I love finding a peaceful spot in a public garden,
        laying on the soft grass, and getting lost in a good story while surrounded by nature. Taking walks through the gardens helps me relax and clear my mind,
        making my reading time even more enjoyable and inspiring.</section>
